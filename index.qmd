# personal R administration

all in on the project based workflow

## How do I...

::: incremental
-   upgrade the version of R I'm using for this project?
-   know which package versions I'm using for this project?
-   move this project from one machine to another?
:::

::: notes
We're extending the lessons from Day 1 to think about what it means to work with R projects over time.
That means that in addition to wanting our individual projects to flow smoothly, we also want to strategize about how to manage different versions of the language, different package versions, and different execution contexts.
Working on an old project on a new computer is a lot like trying to put an app into production.

## focus areas

- installing R
- starting R
  - user and project-specific R configuration
  - `.Renviron`, and `.Rprofile`
-   installing R packages
-   upgrading R

# installing R

## clickOps

## rig

https://github.com/r-lib/rig/

## a lengthy aside

package managers **install**  
language managers **install**  
language versions **install**  
project isolators 

:::{.notes}
this pattern repeats itself across languages and operating systems and so is probably worth paying attention to:
:::

## package managers

software whose job it is to install other software

windows: scoop, chocolatey, winget  
macOS: homebrew  
linux: homebrew  

:::{.callout-warning}
Avoid installing your language with a package manager
:::


## language managers

next, use your package manager to install a language manager:  
rig  
<small> 
pyenv  
nvm  
rustup  
</small>

## language versions

```
$ rig add 4.2.1
```

## project libraries

```r
> install.packages("renv")
> renv::init()
```

## activity

- install rig
- install an additional version of R

# starting R

## 

![](img/R-startup.svg)

::: {.notes}
Scopes:
- system: (usually suffixed by `.site`, per version of R)
- user
- project

user scoped `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron` content is applied _last_

:::

## 

::::{.columns}
`.Renviron` and `.Rprofile` **must** end in a newline.
::: {.column}
:::

::: {.column}
![](img/insert-newline-end.png)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
R will silently throw away the last line if you don't do this
:::

## `.Renviron`

:white_check_mark: R-specific environment variables  
:white_check_mark: API keys  
:x: R code  

## example `.Renviron`

```bash
R_HISTSIZE=100000
GITHUB_PAT=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
CONNECT_API_KEY=DaYK2hBUriSBYUEGIAiyXsRJHSjTYJN3
RETICULATE_PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
```

:::{.notes}
the keys have already been burned, don't worry
:::

## `.Rprofile`

interactive helpers that run in every session

## what to put in `.Rprofile`

- Set a default CRAN mirror 
- Write a welcome message 
- Customize R prompt 
- Selectively change (but be careful) 
  - Options, screen width, numeric display 
  - Load frequently used interactive packages 
  - Aliases / shortcuts for frequently used functions
  
## why shouldn't these go in `.Rprofile`?

::: incremental
- `options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`
- `library(tidyverse)`
- `library(ggplot2)`
- `f <- dplyr::filter`
- `theme_set(theme_bw())`
:::

## `devDependencies`

If something appears in a script, it **should not** be in .Rprofile

## why can these go in `.Rprofile`?

```
library(usethis)
library(devtools)
```

# installing R packages

## Types of R packages

- Binary
- Source

## Binary

- compiled ahead of time
- only R is needed to install

## where to get binaries

|os|cran|[ppm](https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/)|
|-|-|-|
|windows|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark: |
|macos|:white_check_mark:|❌|
|linux|❌|:white_check_mark:|


## Source

- compiled in development environment
- requires extra tools when package uses C, C++, Fortan

## if you don't have tools

```{.r code-line-numbers="11"}
Running `R CMD build`...
* checking for file 'C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpkTUH61\remotes192027624804\tidyverse-dplyr-36ef054/DESCRIPTION' ... OK
* preparing 'dplyr':
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* cleaning src

      -----------------------------------
ERROR: package installation failed
```

## windows

[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

`rig add rtools`

## macOS

XCode

`xcode-select --install`

or download from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

## activity

- install a package from source

```
install.packages("jsonlite", type = "source")
```
